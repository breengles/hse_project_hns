MountainCar-v0 via Table Q Learning (with discretization of both state and action spaces)
=========================================================================================

This folder contains the most simple solution via learning of tabulated Q, i.e. we construct Q function as table for each possible state and action.

In [agent.py](agent.py) the agent itself is discribed.

Experiment is in [experiments.ipynb](experiments.ipynb)
